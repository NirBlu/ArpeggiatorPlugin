# Arpeggiator Plugin

An advanced arpeggiator plugin built using the DISTRHO Plugin Framework (DPF). This plugin generates MIDI arpeggios with customizable speed, patterns, and octave range, allowing for a wide range of musical expression.

## Features

- **Flexible Speed Control**: Set arpeggiator speed up to 693 BPM and enter custom values for ultimate control.
- **Diverse Patterns**:
  - **Up**: Ascending through the notes.
  - **Down**: Descending from the highest note.
  - **Repeat-Twice**: Each note plays twice before moving to the next.
  - **Ascend-Descend**: Cycles up then down through the notes.
  - **Descend-Ascend**: Cycles down then up through the notes.
  - **Repeat-Thrice**: Each note plays three times before moving to the next.
- **Octave Range**: Control how many octaves the arpeggios span.
- **Manual Stop Button**: Stop all notes instantly with a single button.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [DISTRHO Plugin Framework](https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF)
- A DAW that supports LV2 plugins, such as Ardour

### Build Instructions
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ArpeggiatorPlugin.git
   cd ArpeggiatorPlugin
   ```

2. Create a `build` directory and configure the build with `cmake`:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Copy the `.lv2` folder to your system’s LV2 directory (typically `~/.lv2/` on Linux):
   ```bash
   cp -r ArpeggiatorPlugin.lv2 ~/.lv2/
   ```

5. Launch your DAW (e.g., Ardour) and load the plugin from the MIDI Processor plugins.

## Usage

1. **Speed**: Adjust the arpeggiator speed using the slider or type a custom BPM value.
2. **Pattern**: Select from six unique arpeggio patterns to shape the rhythm and feel.
3. **Octave Range**: Increase the octave span to add more harmonic range to your arpeggios.
4. **Stop Button**: Instantly stops all notes when clicked.

## Customization

- **Adjusting Patterns**: Experiment with different patterns to achieve varied musical textures.
- **Speed and BPM Customization**: Use custom BPM values to find the perfect rhythm for your music.
