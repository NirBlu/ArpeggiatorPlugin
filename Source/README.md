Arpeggiator Plugin 
An advanced arpeggiator plugin built using the DISTRHO Plugin Framework (DPF). This plugin generates MIDI arpeggios with customizable speed,
patterns, and octave range, allowing for a wide range of musical expression. 
Features 
Flexible Speed Control: Set arpeggiator speed up to 693 BPM and enter custom values for ultimate control.
Diverse Patterns: 
Up: Ascending through the notes.
Down: Descending from the highest note.
Repeat-Twice: Each note plays twice before moving to the next.
Ascend-Descend: Cycles up then down through the notes.
Descend-Ascend: Cycles down then up through the notes.
Repeat-Thrice: Each note plays three times before moving to the next.
Octave Range: Control how many octaves the arpeggios span.
Manual Stop Button: Stop all notes instantly with a single button. 
Installation 
Prerequisites 
DISTRHO Plugin Framework
